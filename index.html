        <div class="subheading mb-5">Sociology ProfessorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Steven Sanchez and I am interested in studying the social world empirically while also offering possible solutions<br><br>

        My interest in Sociology stems from my background as low-income. Because of this, at an early age I was exposed to financial hardships and its effects on the sense if self and the emotional toll it takes to constantly fear the dips of the economy. Most of my experience has come with working with Sociology professors at UCR as well as non-profit organizations that strive to give low-income communities a support network. Additionally, I have experience in interacting with people in way that provides them information that they may not be exposed to such as the negative influence of emissions on the environment. Of course, getting to the point that I am currently at was no easy task. To gain work experience early on I worked in the fast-food industry, specifically Subway. During my time there I found it surprising how demanding the work despite it being labeled as "unskilled". The pressure to perform was always there and to add to the already high levels of stress short breaks every few hours were the norm. None of my coworkers enjoyed the work they did, they only partook in it because it was the most convenient way for them to earn a wage. Most of them were very much a part what could be regarded as the working class. <br><br>

        Most of them were very much a part what could be regarded as the working class. It was here that I realized that those who are not part of the the upper class are relegated to nothing but the selling of their labor, no matter how ridiculous the wage is. Up until then I had not considered a path to Sociology because I was not exposed to any literature that had profound sociological work. When I got to UCR as an undergraduate I took an intro to Sociology course. That was when I knew I had found my calling. In that class, all of my observations of the world were confirmed in that society is nothing but a cage that holds people to meet the standard of being a good worker under the American Dream. This overwhelming realization led me to involvement in politics as well as research into how other countries offer more of a better standard of living compared to the United States. I was also drawn to the effects of Western imperialism in Latin America because my parents immigrated from Guatemala due to high levels of poverty and crime. Another interest of mine is the impact humans have on climate and what possible solutions there are to stop the worsening of unpredictable weather patterns. CALPIRG at UCR is an organization that I volunteered to work for because they specialize in lobbying representatives to address policy that ignores climate impacts. They also went out of their way to bring awareness of climate change to the student body which I saw as very important due to misinformation of climate change being a common occurrence.
